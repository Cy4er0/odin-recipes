# odin-recipes



  This is a simple recipe site project made with pure HTML and CSS.
  By the end of this project i will be able to demonstrate basic HTML and CSS
  skills by building a basic recipes website.
  I will also be able to have basic familiarity with the git version control
  system and the github platform.
